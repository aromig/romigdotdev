title: "Remodel: Our Office of Geekery"
excerpt: "Repainted and reorganized our office at home. Yellow walls she said. Even though I give the raised Spock eyebrow, I should know by now to never doubt my wife's vision. When it was all done, it looked great. A 3-day weekend well spent."

The office got a bit cramped and we could fit a lot of items in places where we could fit them. That was just it - things were crammed in there and things were in the way of everything else. We've done repainting and a lot of moving things around in the office plenty of times. But this time - this time she wanted to show off our style a bit more.

She had a plan. We got the paint. We got (a lot of) <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60103750/#/50282182" rel="nofollow">shelves from IKEA</a>. We had a 3-day weekend to get this done.

After removing what we had hung there before and dragged the desks (and their contents) to the middle of the room or the living room, I removed the wall-length work surface we made some years ago that the kids used as a desk which was mounted to the shared wall. The paint was uneven and it needed to be sanded to get the seam to appear as gradually as possible. I spackled the holes and sanded them, and then got to painting. And painting some more because it seems you always need another coat than you estimated.

I measured out a plan to hang the IKEA shelves to fit our toys and provide enough room so we didn't knock our heads into them when standing up from our desks. I bought some <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Blue-Hawk-4-Pack-1-3-4-in-x-1-8-in-Dia-Mini-Drywall-Anchor-Screws-Included/3415978" rel="nofollow">heavier-duty anchors</a> to hold them up.

After getting the shelves mounted, she proceeded to find homes for all of our stuff while I hung the wall decorations. When we were done, it was amazing to see how much more open the floor was. It was a nice project that shows that often hidden side of a person: their geekiness. Don't hide it. Just show it off.
