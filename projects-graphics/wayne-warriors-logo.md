When building the [Wayne Music Club mock-up site](/projects/wayne-music-club-mock-up), there was no resource available for a simple "Wayne Warriors" logo. The closest I found was contained with a black & grey carbon fiber background. It wasn't a simple Magic Wand job because of the similar colors but I was able to extract it with additional tools and methods.
