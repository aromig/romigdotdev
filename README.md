This is the personal site & blog for Adam Romig. I am a full-stack developer located in Dayton, Ohio. I enjoy coding & learning what I can in order to make my team's and customers' lives easier.

I created this site to give my new domain name a home as well as showcase my writing & my past work.

This site is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) & [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
