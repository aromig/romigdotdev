A "Global PC Request" form was introduced by Service-Now team to facilitate equipment requests. In order to keep using our process, I wrote a RESTful web service to accept request records from Service-Now in json format to insert into our database. Additional functions query database to gather additional information not provided by originating form as well as sending an email notification after insertion.
