The admin staff of MMOCentralForums.com tasked me to develop a new web site for their hosted gaming group/guild. The site is a total overhaul of the site design, database structure, and underlying server-side code as well as being integrated with the respective forumâ€™s vBulletin software in regards to user identity. Features include user profile creation, group activity reporting, report history, and member & schedule listings. The administrative control panel allows privileged users to manage profiles, schedule, reports, and miscellaneous settings.
