Built upon the UserVoice SaaS platform, iSpark is a tool for internal employees to submit and vote on new ideas for potential adoption by the RELX Core Technology division.

I was a member of a 3-person project team, working in conjunction with another developer, to build the templates for the site.

This included:

- Attended training with the vendor on the admin control panel as well as checkpoint meetings with the project lead.
- Researching appropriate company branding guidelines & UserVoice templating documentation.
- Building an HTML mock-up to present to team for consideration & chosen for the general design.
- Building the templates using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrating with UserVoice's template variables/conditionals via their implementation of the Liquid engine.
- Working in Photoshop to prepare branding and stock images.
