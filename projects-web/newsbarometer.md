News Barometer is a local weekly newspaper in the Florida Keys. The redesign of their web site provides a cleaner interface, direct weekly publishing via a content management system, and access to archived editions. The content is managed through WordPress, normally a daily blogging software, which has been customized and themed to show articles in a weekly format to match the print publication. Recently the site has undergone a slight redesign to make it more responsive to mobile devices & smaller resolutions.
