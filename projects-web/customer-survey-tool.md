I created a web application to replace an existing tool to track customer satisfaction for RETS support teams. The new site featured a redesigned survey and a back-end administration panel for sending surveys to users & reporting the results in different forms (averages, details, comments). An individual "My Results" page was made available for team members to monitor their own ratings.
